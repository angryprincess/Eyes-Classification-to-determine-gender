# Eyes-Classification-to-determine-gender
The goal of the project is to implement a classifier using a Neural network using Keras Framework to determine gender by eye.

Here is the link top the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavelbiz/eyes-rtte


Here are the steps I have followed:

    1. Performed EDA and any data preprocessing required.
    2. Implemented 3 classification models as below:
        a. Model 1 - Benchmark model - SVM (Suport Vector Machine)
        b. Model 2 - Multilayer Perceptron Model
        c. Model 3 â€“ CNN model
        d. For the two neural net models (Model 2 & Model 3)
    i. I have stated the intuition behind the architecture of the neural network
    ii. I have used techniques like dropout, L1/L2 regularization, Early Stopping, Data Augmentation and I have experimented with hyperparameters.
    iii. Plotted training loss and validation loss
    iv. Plotted training accuracy and validation accuracy
    3. For each model I have showed the performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall).
    4. Compared the performance of the 3 models
    5. Provided observations/reasoning where necessary and included a conclusion section at the end of the notebook.
